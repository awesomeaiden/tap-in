# tap-in
The quick and easy way to share your contact information and social media accounts with anyone.  Whether you're in class, at a party, out on the town, or on the golf course - just tap in!

### Installation and build
To install and build the backend from source, simply run:
```
npm install
npm build-and-start
```
in the "backend" directory.  This should install the necessary dependencies, transpile the typescript to javascript, and start the node server.  This is the backend API that the frontend will connect to.

You can use the same install and start commands for the frontend, but depending on your configuration, you may need to set up an android or iOS virtual device, or connect a physical device to see the app running.
